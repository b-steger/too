There are many contributors to OpenStreetMap. There are more than eight million registered OpenStreetMap users.

It is impossible to adequately acknowledge the many individuals who survey their neighbourhoods with GPS and notepad, or trace over licensed satellite imagery, to contribute the most complete, most current, most accurate data to OpenStreetMap. Also, some publishers (listed and attributed below) allow their data to be included in OpenStreetMap.

If you are looking for how to attribute OSM, see Legal FAQ.

Inclusion of data (including data derived from photos) in OpenStreetMap does not imply that the original data provider endorses OpenStreetMap, provides any warranty, or accepts any liability.

Finding contributors

You may wish to try and find a list of contributors in a specific area. You can do this by browsing to the desired area, and moving to the 'history' tab, which displays details of all changesets intersecting this area. Generally the display includes a large number of 'big' changesets which covered a big area, and which are less likely to include significant updates actually within your desired area (but can't be sure). Using the data layer might be the better option to view the contributors to a single map object.

You can find users who have last edited all elements in an area. This information is returned in map call e.g. the data you get when you download an area in JOSM. This can also be visualised using OSM Mapper. However this may be discounting the original creators of elements (possibly a more important contribution). You can find the original creator of an element, and all users who have since edited the element, by querying its history. Through the API, your query would be of the form http://api.openstreetmap.org/api/0.6/<objtype>/<id>/history where <objtype> is: 'way' or 'node' and <id> is the ID number of the item. This would have to be performed for every node and way within the area.

Contributor specific attribution and disclaimer

In addition to the individual contributions from our members, several commercial and government bodies have contributed and / or permitted to be contributed their data to OpenStreetMap. This may only be a partial list. Imports are also listed at Import/Catalogue.

A small number of contributors are listed on the www.openstreetmap.org/copyright page because we have used data under a license that requires that attribution.^[1]

British Columbia

OSM may contain information from DataBC or derived from DataBC data. This information is provided by the Province of British Columbia under the Open Government License for Government of BC Information v.BC1.0

DataBC products are a mixture of vector and raster products. Where OpenStreetMap contributors have made use of raster data (mapping images) then any data from these within the OpenStreetMap database will have been derived, principally by hand tracing. Where DataBC products were made available in vector format, these may have been partially or completely imported into OpenStreetMap as modified vector data. Modification may include subtle positional modification, modification of data attributes, updating of data or integration of data with other data.

The Government of BC does not endorse OpenStreetMap or OpenStreetMap's use of DataBC product data.

●Haiti

Some post-earthquake data in and around Port-au-Prince Haiti is derived by permission from images copyright GeoEye.

On 14 January 2010, GeoEye granted OpenStreetMap permission to derive data from a limited set of their aerial images related to the Haiti earthquake of Tuesday 12 January 2010. Find more information on the WikiProject Haiti Page.

Exceptionally Google gave permission for aerial imagery flown post-earthquake (on January 17 2010 and January 21 2010) to be used by OSM contributors to map areas of Haiti. The permission was transmitted on twitter by Mikel Maron on January 21st, and Christoph Schmidt processed the images as tiles which were made available almost immediately, see Old Haiti Imagery. The imagery was available earlier, but was released with a non-commercial clause which required an exception to be made for use on OSM>

State-level

California

All California state GIS data are specifically exempted from having any license under state law regarding "right of access to public records." Furthermore, this was upheld by the California Supreme Court.

California Protected Areas Database

Some data regarding state parks and other "protected" areas in the state are entered from California Protected Areas Database (CPAD) data published by GreenInfo Network. CPAD contains data on lands owned in fee by governments, non-profits and some private entities that are protected for open space purposes. Data include all such areas in California, from small urban parks to large national parks and forests, mostly aligned to assessor parcel boundaries, though CPAD considers California's Department of Parks and Recreation data authoritative when it comes to state parks boundaries. From an email from Maianna Voge, Associate Director, GreenInfo Network, March 25, 2019: "CPAD is not copyrighted, you are free to use it in OSM. We usually ask for attribution (specified in the shp metadata), but that’s just a courtesy, not a requirement."

Please see California/Using CPAD data for suggestions on how to logically map the CPAD tags to OSM tags.

Connecticut

Some data regarding state-owned public access facilities may be entered from the DEP Property dataset. The metadata specifically state that the data are in the public domain. The site notes: "Once acquired, any modification made to the data must be noted in the metadata," - a request easily satisfied by the OSM changeset mechanism. It requests attribution: " When printing this information on a map or using it in a software application, please acknowledge the State of Connecticut, Department of Environmental Protection as the original source for this information."

Illinois Height Modernization LiDAR Data

Per an email to user System-users-3.svgjdcarls2 (on osm, edits, contrib, heatmap, chngset com.) and the Remote Sensing Data Manager of the Illinois State Geological Survey:

    After much research I have found that you are granted permissions to use the LiDAR data to make derivatives such as building footprints and similar derived products.  As long as you follow the guidelines mentioned in the metadata to cite ISGS as the source using the proper metadata for the LiDAR this would be fine.

It is requested, but not required, that the IndianaMap Data Sharing Initiative between IGIC, Indiana Office of Technology (IOT), Indiana Geographic Information Office (GIO), Indiana Department of Homeland Security (IDHS), Indiana Geological Survey (IGS) and participating Indiana counties be cited in any products generated from this data set. If citing, the following source citation language should be included: [COUNTY_ADDRESS_POINTS_IDHS_IN: Address Points Maintained by County Agencies in Indiana, Twentieth Harvest (Indiana Department of Homeland Security, Point feature class), 20151217].

Maine

Address data was imported from "Maine_E911_Addresses_Roads_PSAP" provided by "Maine Emergency Services Communications Bureau (ESCB) branch of the Maine Public Utilities Commission (PUC)" in 2020. More information about the source data can be found at https://www.maine.gov/megis/.

Maryland State Government

All Maryland state GIS data is specifically exempted from having any license under state law. The passed law, Senate Bill 94 (2015) repealed the code that gave governments the authority to compel a citizen to enter into a contract (e.g. a license) before distributing geographic data^[3].

Further, all local and municipal governments within in the State of Maryland are governed by the same law. Therefore, even if a county or local government website lists a license requirement, the license is invalidated by the law^[4]. Some local governments have not updated their terms after the passage of this bill.

Data from the Maryland DNR portal is in the public domain according to Dave Foreman, GIS Analyst, MD DNR. I --ElliottPlack (talk) 16:59, 20 April 2013 (UTC) spoke to Dave at the TUgis conference in 2013 and secured permission to put the data on OpenStreetMap, and that there are no use constraints. The DNR is gradually migrating their data to the Maryland Open Data GIS Portal, which operates under the same public domain license.

Statewide Parcel Database

According to Wisconsin's Public Records Law, Wisconsin's parcel data is considered Public Domain and available for use in OSM. Included is the following disclaimer:

    The information shown on this map was obtained from Wisconsin’s counties in 2018 and thus may not be the most current, comprehensive data available. Source data for parcel polygons was collected between January–July of 2018. However, the tax roll year for most records is 2017, as the assessment cycle lags a year behind. To ensure the most current, comprehensive parcel data, consult the local government’s land information websites first, or contact the city or county land information office directly. The next release of the statewide parcel layer, V5, is tentatively scheduled for June 30, 2019.

    No warranty, expressed or implied, is made regarding accuracy, completeness, or legality of the information herein. The boundaries depicted on this map do not represent the legal ownership boundaries of any property. The delineation of legal boundaries may only be conducted by a licensed surveyor.

The OpenStreetMap Database covering the United Kingdom "Contains Ordnance Survey Data © Crown copyright and database right 2010." Contains public sector information licensed under the Open Government Licence v1.0, Open Government Licence v2.0, and Open Government Licence v3.0.

Specifically OpenStreetMap has used products released by Ordnance Survey as part of the OpenData™ suite on 1st April 2010. OpenStreetMap contributors are asked to also add a source tag to data entered into OpenStreetMap where this has specifically originated from an Ordnance Survey OpenData™ product.

Ordnance Survey OpenData™ products are a mixture of vector and raster products. Where OpenStreetMap contributors have made use of raster data (mapping images) then any data from these within the OpenStreetMap database will have been derived, principally by hand tracing. Where Ordnance Survey OpenData™ products were made available in vector format, these may have been partially or completely imported into OpenStreetMap as modified vector data. Modification may include subtle positional modification or modification of data attributes.

Ordnance Survey does not endorse OpenStreetMap or OpenStreetMap's use of Ordnance Survey OpenData™ product data.

Information in the "List of Streets" maintained by local councils

Under section 36(6) Highways Act 1980, each Highways Authority has to maintain an official list of "highways maintainable at the public expense". Typically this list will include each public road name, reference number, and a description of the start and end points. Cycleways and some urban footways are also listed. The information is useful in particular for identifying and classifying unsurfaced tracks which are technically public highways but may not appear so (e.g. routes shown on OS maps as "Other Route with Public Access"). Permission has been obtained from the following councils to make use of their "List of Streets" files:
